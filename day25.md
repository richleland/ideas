Ten things I deny myself permission to buy, and why

1. Jeep Wrangler - because it's not a practical car for safety with young kids (which I drive around a lot)
1. Nintendo Switch - because it's expensive, not really necessary, and not contributing towards long-term goals
1. Table saw - because I don't do enough wood work to warrant it and I can get boards ripped at the local stores
1. Greenhouse - because I probably wouldn't make as much time for it as I think I would, and I could build it myself
1. Riding mower - because it's expensive and I get needed exercise with a push mower
1. A new computer - because work supplies one and our old computer seems to be sufficient for the time being
1. A new guitar - because they are expensive and I haven't played much over the last few years
1. Ratchet set - because the old ones I have seem to be working OK thus far
1. New slippers - because my current slippers do the job, despite the appearance
1. Sonos speakers - because they are expensive and a want, not a need
