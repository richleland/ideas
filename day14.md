1. How does where you live affect your ability to get into software engineering depending on your demographics?
1. Why do climate zones have an impact on the types of plants you can grow successfully?
1. What real-life effects have science fiction played a part in? How did they play a part and why?
1. Would education outcomes improve if you removed federal- or state-level mandates for classroom instruction and instead allowed instructors to develop the curriculum themselves?
1. What health effects can be correlated to the use of computers and mobile devices? What are the economic impacts of the health effects?
1. How does the weather affect overall health and happiness? Establish some way to measure and perform across major cities in the U.S.
