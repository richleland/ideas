Ten things I have at home that I don't need which I could either donate and/or throw away or re-purpose

1. All the records and compact discs
1. Old toys the kids don't use anymore
1. Radio in the garage
1. Clothes that I no longer wear (definitely some tees)
1. Unused computer equipment
1. The drafting table
1. Leftover garden wood could be used to build a desk
1. Duplicate tools including wrenches, screwdrivers, drills
1. Unused gym equipment - old jump rope, bench
1. Posters and extra picture frames
