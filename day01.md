### List 10 things that you don't like and then turn them into things you can be grateful for.

1. I dislike some of the challenges of communication and collaboration at a company with offices on separate coasts of the United States.

  I'm grateful that we have the opportunity to have a presence across the country and people that can respond to our customers and the complexities of running an online service across a broad range of hours.

1. I dislike how my garage always seems to find its way back to a state of disarray.

  I'm grateful that I keep my garage in order enough to allow me to park both cars in it every day.

1. It irritates me that one of my cats has effectively destroyed our basement couch.

  I'm grateful that I have a basement and a cat that's pretty chill.

1. I get frustrated when I hit issues in software engineering that I have trouble solving due to my lack of a formal education.

  I'm thankful that I've been able to learn from and work with so many smart people that being self-taught isn't a barrier to a successful career.

1. I find contractors and the process of finding reliable, responsive contractors infuriating.

  I'm glad I can afford to hire experts to do work that I either don't want to do or haven't been able to acquire the skills for.

1. I dislike that I cannot seem to get into a regular cadence of workouts.

  I'm grateful that I can periodically get into a gym and exercise. I'm also grateful to have so many outdoor activities close by that make fitting simple exercise into the day easy.

1. I find it irritating that there are no relaxed social sports programs for adults in the county I live in.

  I'm grateful that sports programs for my kids are so plentiful in the county I live in.

1. Despite living here my entire life, I hate how humid the weather is on the east coast of the United States.

  Spring and Fall are beautiful on the east coast. It's Spring as I write this, and the windows are open, the breeze is blowing, and birds are chirping. All while I work from home in my sunroom.

1. The lack of acknowledgement that we need major changes in leadership by the democratic party is frustrating following the election of Trump.

  Moderates in the country are voicing the need for open dialogue with people from all parties, urging us all to set aside differences in the interest of progress.

1. I dislike the burden work travel puts on my family and the complexities involved with coordinating the travel.

  I'm grateful that I get to see different parts of the world and spend some face-to-face time with my colleagues.
