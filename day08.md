10 movies that caused a deep impression on you, and why

1. It's a Wonderful Life. I didn't watch this movie for the first time until after my kids were born. Every year I watch it and every year it reminds me of how great my family, friends, and life are.
1. The Fountain. This is one of the most confusing, surreal, and stunning movies on my this list. I love the way the film intertwined timelines and lives while making a visually beautiful work of art.
1. Lion. This is such an emotional film. The main character gets lost in India as a small child, and as a parent I instantly empathized with the main character and his family. It made me think of the great loss I would feel if one of my children went missing. I definitely gave my kids a huge hug the next day.
1. Schindler's List. This film brought to life the horrors of the holocaust and the profound difference one person can make in the face of terror.
1. Saving Private Ryan. This film brought to life all the stories of the horrors and challenges of World War II my grandfather had been telling me for years. Though my grandfather was fighting the war in the pacific, the profound loss and sacrifice in the film gave me an appreciation for everything my grandfather did for his country and his family.
1. American History X. Growing up in an area that had some neo-nazi individuals, this film struck a chord with me. I remember thinking I knew people like this and I despised everything they stood for. I was grateful for the way my parents raised me to treat other with respect and reject racism and hate.
1. Shutter Island. A mind-bending film that made me appreciate movies that could be challenging to follow, but worth the effort. It also enhanced my understanding of mental illness and what the depth of that illness could look like.
1. Pan's Labyrinth. What a dark, beautiful film. I loved the fantasy aspects and the art of the film. I remember not knowing it was in Spanish when I started watching it. A few minutes in I completely forgot I was watching a foreign language film. It definitely opened me up to the world of foreign films.
1. Christmas Story. I've been watching this film since I was a kid, and the Christmas season depicted in the film felt so much like my own Christmases growing up. It probably helped that the film was released when I was a small child, because all of the styles and characters still remind me of my upbringing to this day.
1. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Never before these films had I seen a fantasy portrayed on screen so closely to how I envisioned it in my head while reading the books. They captured the characters, the emotions, and the expansiveness of the world in amazing detail.
