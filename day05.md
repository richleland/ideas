10 new technologies for smart refrigerators

1. A camera so you can leave a video message for other members of your family. For example, mom leaves early in the morning and wants to tell her kids to have a great day at school.
1. A voice memo capability so you can set reminders for groceries and sync them with your phone. "Add milk and a dozen eggs to my grocery list." Even better it could send your list to a grocery service for delivery when you are ready.
1. Doors that can change from opaque to transparent, allowing you to see the contents of the fridge without opening it.
1. A programmable exterior that allows users to change the exterior color. Imagine changing the look of your fridge and other appliances in the kitchen from black to stainless to white to red.
1. A programmable temperature for water which would allow you to get hot water for cups of tea or hot cocoa or ice cold water for a glass of lemonade on a hot Summer day.
1. A screen that shows your day ahead based on data from your calendar, weather data, and news.
1. Compartments that can have their temperature set as well as a timer based on the type of food so you can properly chill an item and get an alarm when the item should be at the desired temperature. Examples could include pudding or cookie dough.
1. Rearrange items in your fridge using an app. Drag items from one shelf to another and rearrange shelves. The fridge takes the instructions and re-configures the items however you specify.
1. Proximity-controlled doors that automatically (and slowly) open when you approach. This is a help especially when putting something large or heavy in the fridge. The doors could also automatically close when no movement is detected nearby, saving energy.
1. Have a built-in snowball maker that allows you to pick the flavor which triggers the fridge to shave the ice, add the syrup and boom! Snowball!
