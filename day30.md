Ten ways in which you can improve your sleep

1. Work out an hour before bed time. Working out towards the end of the day always seems to help me sleep better.
1. Start the day at 5am. Whenever I start early I'm super productive and I find myself wanting to go to sleep earlier, resulting in more sleep overall.
1. Do a 30 minute stretching routine or meditation before bed. This is very relaxing and prepares the body for additional rest. It also quiets the mind, making falling asleep easier.
1. Read some fiction. Reading near bedtime always ends up with me falling fast asleep.
1. Don't do anything work-related after hours.
1. Create a nighttime routine and stick to it.
1. During the school year, follow the same routine as my wife, who is a high school teacher. Wake up at 5am, go to sleep around 9am or 9:30am.
1. Refrain from device usage after 8pm.
1. Go for a short walk in the neighborhood half an hour before target sleep time.
1. Play nature sounds on the echo for about 15 minutes in bed.
