Ten people that made an impact in your life and why

1. Eric Wallen was my high school visual communications teacher at Eastern Tech High School. He worked for AT&T at the time and introduced me to programming through HTML from 1995-1997. He also showed me what can happen when you trust someone, giving me a large amount of responsibility and autonomy.
1. Edward Burns was a high school science teacher of mine. He showed me how interesting science can be. He also pushed me as a student and had high expectations, which he held us all to.
1. Dave Taub hired me straight out of high school to work for his design firm. He took a huge chance on me. I spent five years working for his company and learned a lot about design, development, and business under his guidance.
1. Cory Key hired me to join a new interactive group within Discovery Communications, the parent company of the Discovery Channel. While working with Cory I transitioned from a designer to a developer. I was able to work for a large, well known company, where I met friends I still have to this day.
1. Erin Leland, my wife and the mother of my children, has taught so many things - how to be a better human, how to build a family, how to cope with adversity, and how to challenge one another (among other things).
1. Brad Hamblin is a childhood friend. We grew together as artists, musicians, and humans. We lived blocks apart growing up, went to elementary, middle, and high school together, lived together during our 20s in Baltimore, and worked together in our first career roles at the same company. He showed me what fearless creativity and true friendship looks like.
1. Joanne Leland taught me to be kind, stay away from bad people, and always push myself. She always believed in me and supported me even when she didn't agree with the choices I made.
1. Henry Leland taught me about hard work, integrity, and patience. My father was an entrepreneur and I was lucky enough to spend some time working for him. He's a jack of many trades, and handed down a desire to work with my hands. He showed me how to be calm, caring, and patient.
1. Joe Hilseberg introduced me to my wife Erin. Long before that, Joe showed me what it meant to be a fierce friend, full of life. I've had so many fun times with Joe. He introduced me to so many great people I'm thankful to know.
1. Anthony Kowalewski taught me about respect for history. As a member of the Navy in World War II, he told stories that expressed the sacrifices made by the greatest generation. He was also a wonderful artist and passed down his creativity, always eager to spend time drawing with me, teaching me techniques.
