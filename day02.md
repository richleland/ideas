List 10 apps you would like to use. It does not matter whether they already exist or not, think of what would be helpful for you in particular.

1. Garden tracking - something that can track plants from seed to harvest based on location.
1. Meal randomizer - an app where you can pick some common meals/combinations your family eats and it would randomly pick similar recipes for variety week to week.
1. General contractor - an app where you request work and thoroughly vetted contractors can bid on your work. Would also take care of scheduling and penalties/upsides for late/early work completion.
1. Deep work planner - something to break up tasks by the half hour. Similar to what I currently do in a notebook form. Could predict / learn common tasks.
1. Lawn care - app that takes the size and state of your yard and builds a plan for optimum lawn health. When to overseed, fertilize, etc.
1. Somebody's home - tell the app when you'll be out of town. It communicates with connected outlets in your home and randomizes turning things on/off while you're out of town.
1. Infrared grilling - point your mobile device at the grill and it shows temperatures for whatever is cooking.
1. Tree identifier - lets you take a picture of leaves or parts of a tree and shows you what type of tree it is
1. Brand radar - takes a pulse of customer sentiment towards your brand from various sources online, alerts you to potential issues your customers may be struggling with or showing frustration about.
1. Tech charity finder - app that helps connect software engineers with charities that need technical help.
