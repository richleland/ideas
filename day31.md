Ten times when you laughed out loud

1. The end of one of the Bill Burr comedy specials on Netflix where he finishes with a tie in to crazy old man look, which he discussed in the beginning of the special.
1. Pretty much any time I play cards against humanity with my family and friends.
1. The time I lived in Baltimore and a purple Nissan pick up was going the wrong way up our one-way street with two guys in boxers chasing it with baseball bats.
1. During Dave Chapelle's special on Netflix when he talked about the times he interacted with O.J. Simpson.
1. Watching Rick and Morty when Morty saves a sentient being and Rick chastises Morty for killing his favorite customer and saving a mind-reading fart.
1. Every time I watch funny cat videos with my kids.
1. When living in Baltimore hanging out at O'Donnell square at 1am, a guy came out of a bar with a soaked pant leg. When asked if he was alright, the guy said "oh yeah, I'm doing great!" and proceeded to pull a pint of Guinness out of his pant pocket.
1. Playing fibbage with our neighbors on Waterford Drive during our progressive dinner.
1. When I made a video presenting the water thingy 2000 - a crazy water bottle invention made by my 8 year old daughter.
1. The first time I gave my cats catnip - hilarious!
