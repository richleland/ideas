10 ways you could make your traveling easier next time you fly

1. Wear pants with a drawstring so I can pack my belt instead of taking it off and putting it back on
1. Wear slip on shoes or flip flops/sandals
1. Only pack what can fit into a backpack
1. Leave 30 minutes earlier than I think I need to so I have plenty of time to relax and wait for my flight to board
1. Always take flights from the closest airport so my time to get to the airport is reduced
1. Apply for TSA pre-check so I can get through security faster
1. Pack some snacks so I don't have to eat airport food
1. Get a Nintendo switch so I can play games during longer flights to pass time
1. Get a slim wallet to carry only credit card and license
1. Charge my devices overnight so I don't have to charge them at the airport
